You can find a lot of information from internet or books which intoroduce landmarks, restaurants, shopping streets, parks and so on. But I decided to explore the cities with different approach by using data science. What are the characteristics of Japan's two major cities? Are Tokyo and Osaka similar or not? Could data scienc find Interesting discovery?\nThe target audience of this report are anyone who is interested in Japanese culture or who wants to trabel to Tokyo or Osaka."

I will use clustering analysis methodology for each district and it's convenient that two cities have simillar number of districs. In addition, below is basic comparison of Tokyo and Osaka, which could complement the results of data analysis (although I won't use these info in Python programming)."
